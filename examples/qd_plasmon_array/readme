User defined routines are stored in the .usr file.
quantum_dot.usr is an example file, doing 3 QDs and one plasmon.
Making a new system is as simple as making a new .usr file, and specifying
the .usr file in the compilation, as seen below. For example, one could make
a new file, 2plasmons.usr, and put the other system in there (within the same
folder).


To compile: ../../bin/makenekQ -a linux-gnu-pgi quantum_dot.usr
To run:     ../../bin/nek sample 1
            sample is the name of the (unused) input file. It is not used, but needs to be there.
            1 is the number of cores. Currently, more than one core is unstable
